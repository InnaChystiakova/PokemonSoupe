# PokemonSoupe
Application made according to the test task. It allows to load a list of pokemins from the following api https://pokeapi.co
## Functionality
From the beginning application can load a list of pokemos. User can tap on the any of them and see the detail screen with the following pokemon details:
1. Pokemon main info (name, ID, weight, height, base experience)
2. Pokemon front picture
3. Pokemon status: if pokemon is default then a checkmark picture appears. Elsewhere xmark.
4. Polemon stats: a list of stats with their basic characteristics (ID, name, game index). If stat is only for attack, a baseball image appears near the stat.
## Approach
Main design pattern is MVVM. Includes pagination on scrolling and unit testing. Very simple functionality doesn't require third-party libraries.
